# Movement_Analysis

This project consists in analysing the user's movement with sensors of two different types.
One sensor is the Kinect which tracks the user's hands and the other is the accelerometer of a smartphone.
By comparing the recording of both sensors, the program is able to determine in which hand he was holding the smartphone.
